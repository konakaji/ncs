# Generative quantum eigensolver 

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

GQE is the brand-new algorithm where the training of the generative model mimics the search of the ground state of the Hamiltonian.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- We checked it works with Python 3.8.

### Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage 
- Small-size experiment using the simple model
  - [/gqe/notebooks/run_heisenberg.ipynb](https://github.com/konakaji/gqe/blob/master/notebooks/run_heisenberg.ipynb) (New!)
  - [/gqe/task/run_heisenberg.py](https://github.com/konakaji/gqe/tree/master/task)
- Small-size experiment using the energy-based model
  - [/gqe/task/run_heisenberg_iid.py](https://github.com/konakaji/gqe/blob/master/task/run_deep_heisenberg.py)

### Important modules
See /gqe/notebooks/run_heisenberg.ipynb to learn hohttps://github.com/konakaji/gqe/blob/master/task/run_deep_heisenberg.py to combine those modules.

#### /gqe/energy_estimator/
The module to calculate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian and its gradient for each parameter. 
- iid.py: It assumes that the gate at each position is generated from i.i.d. distribution.
- others: To be updated.

#### /gqe/energy_model/
The generative model implemented by the neural network.
- iid.py: The neural network represents a probability distribution that is independent of the position.
- others: To be updated.

#### /gqe/simple_model/
The generative model implemented the simple model. 
The probability distribution is directly parameterized by optimizable parameters.

#### /gqe/operator_pool/
Each gate operation is generated by exponentiating the operators in the operator pool. 
For instance, if $O_j$ is included in the operator pool, $e^{i\theta_jO_j}$ can be generated by the model.
